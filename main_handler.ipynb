At the same event in May 2020, Huang unveiled a new chip architecture in Ampere, and analyst expect he will use this year’s event to unveil the company’s next-generation chip architecture code-named “Lovelace,” after the 19th century English mathematician Ada Lovelace, generally considered to be the world’s first computer programmer for her work on Charles Babbage’s theoretical Analytical Engine.

       "{'GME': [\"Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY): Shares moved higher in after-hours trading, after surging nearly 25% on Monday, ahead of the retailer’s highly anticipated strategic update August 31. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Bed Bath & Beyond is close to finalizing a loan of nearly $400 million as it seeks to boost liquidity. Shares of the meme stock have soared this month and on pace for a record monthly gain in August, with the stock rallying more than 170%. Bed Bath & Beyond’s gains lifted other meme favorites, including GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Best Buy (BBY): Best Buy is in focus ahead of its quarterly results before the bell Tuesday. The company cut its full year profit and sales forecast in July, citing softening demand. Best Buy CEO Corie Barry wrote “as high inflation has continued and consumer sentiment has deteriorated, customer demand within the consumer electronics industry has softened even further, leading to Q2 financial results below the expectations we shared in May.” The retailer is expected to post adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.35 per share on revenue of $10.33 billion, according to Wall Street's consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Baidu (BIDU): Baidu shares fell Monday ahead of the Chinese tech giant’s earnings Tuesday before the bell. Covid disruptions are expected to weigh on results, with the Street forecasting its first negative sales growth in two years. Daily active users for the quarter are estimated to total 228.4 million. Peloton (PTON): Peloton filed to delay its 10-K, saying it requires more time to complete accounting disclosures. According to the regulatory filing, Peloton needs additional time “to permit completion of the accounting and disclosures” related to its recent announcement to exit its last mile warehouses, “including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as it relates to its accounts and disclosures related to these strategic business developments and for its registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, to complete its necessary audit procedures over these matters,” according to the filing. Peloton shares have fallen -62% in the past six months.\",\n",

       "  'Survey finds full-time MBA graduates in North America benefit the most from salary bump while Asia Pacific graduates record the biggest increase in rating of the overall value of degrees RESTON, Va., Sept. 14, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Despite market fear of an imminent recession, 86 percent of 2022 business school graduates were employed at the time of graduation, up from 80 percent in 2021, according to a survey report released today by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC). Contributing to the favorable trends are the regional results of graduates who studied in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. Among graduates of Asia-Pacific business schools, this year 91 percent report being employed at the time of graduation, compared with 78 percent in 2021. Similarly, among European graduates, 90 percent indicate they were employed this year compared with 75 percent last year. The annual Enrolled Students Survey from GMAC, a global association of leading graduate business schools, aims to better understand current trends in student and recent graduates’ evaluations and outcomes of their graduate management education (GME). Conducted in May-June 2022, this year’s survey explores the views of 1,718 respondents from nearly 300 business schools in 57 countries around the word on their overall GME experience, job search, and compensation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, the responding graduates of participating schools reported a median percentage increase in total compensation—including base salary and all other compensation—of 29 percent. Notably, among North American school graduates, those who attended full-time MBA programs reported a pre-GME total compensation median of US$80,000, and a post-GME total compensation median of US$120,000—an impressive 50 percent increase. “With the volatile economic conditions and organizational challenges brought on by the pandemic, well-rounded and prepared business leaders and managers are especially in demand in the current job market,” said Matt Hazenbush, director of research analysis and communications at GMAC and author of the report. “As the survey findings suggest, graduate management education provides students with a powerful leg up for their career.” Other Key Findings Most students who set out to make a career change or gain a promotion',\n",

       "  \"Meme stocks, once the darling of the stock market last year, have seen a huge resurgence this month. This is especially thanks to easing inflation, a drop in Treasury yields and declining commodity prices that have resulted in risk-on trade. Additionally, attractive valuations drove investors to these stocks (read: Dow Jones Reclaims 34,000: ETFs to Ride On).As such, ETFs targeting meme stocks like Roundhill MEME ETF MEME, VanEck Social Sentiment ETF BUZZ, SoFi Social 50 ETF SFYF and AXS FOMO ETF FOMO have been on the rise over the past month.In fact, trading in single stock options has shot higher in recent weeks, with a 10-day average daily trading volume at a more-than six-month high of nearly 25 million contracts, per Trade Alert data.Meme stocks are those that grabbed immense investor interest due to hype on social media and online forums like Reddit, WallStreetBets and Robinhood, rather than the company fundamentals, resulting in a surge in volumes and share price. Meme stocks are triggered by small traders who cause a short squeeze on the stock. Short squeeze is a term used by market participants to refer to a phenomenon where short sellers in a stock, who have placed their bets on its fall, rush to hedge their positions or buy the stock in the event of an adverse price movement, in order to cover their losses. This leads to a sharp rise in demand for shares, and a huge rally in share prices. On Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, Bed Bath & Beyond BBBY, GameStop GME, and AMC Entertainment AMC were among the top 10 most talked about stocks. Since the June 17 bottom, Bed Bath, GameStop and AMC Entertainment surged 65.1%, 8% and 43.8%, respectively. Investors betting against the three well-known meme stocks have lost about $1.65 billion this month after the shares soared in value, prompting a short squeeze.The return of the meme craze indicates that investors are getting more comfortable with taking on more risk in their portfolios after they saw big declines in some of their favorite stock holdings. However, investing in these stocks is a risky choice\",\n",
       "  \"No-fee trading has transformed the retail trading landscape, making it possible for everyday traders to participate in the markets. Payment For Order Flow (PFOF) — fees for trades paid to brokerages by market makers like Citadel and Virtu — have garnered increased attention since the GameStop (GME) saga grabbed national attention last year. A new study aimed at identifying variation in price execution across different brokers using six accounts found a large variation among platforms such as Robinhood (HOOD) and E-trade. “There's just a huge difference in execution between the six different brokers that we used,” said Christopher Schwarz, University of California Irvine professor of finance and faculty director of the Center for Investment and Wealth Management. “Essentially, what we found is the amount the broker is getting paid for the trades really had no relation to how much execution your — what price execution you were getting. And there's really no way for you to know ahead of time which broker was giving you the best price execution of these trades and which broker was giving you the worst execution,” said Schwarz. Although the study aims to look at the dynamics surrounding no-fee trading and PFOF, when asked, Schwarz mentioned the brokerage with the best outcome. “The best broker in terms of market trades only, looking at market trades only, was TD Ameritrade. They were number one,” said Schwarz. The professor's team found price execution data needs to be provided at the broker level. This way consumers can better compare brokerages. “In other words, what Citadel gives you is just an average of the price execution they'll give you on any Apple trade. And, essentially, what we found is the market centers are systematically giving brokers different pricing,” said Schwarz. To solve this, market makers should say “exactly what kind of pricing you get at TD versus Robinhood versus eTrade versus Fidelity. And then consumers have a much better way to make a comparison about what kind of price execution that they're getting,” he added. Ines is a markets reporter covering equities.

I want to begin by reiterating the deep appreciation we have for our stockholders' unrivaled enthusiasm, passion and support. As we work to transform GameStop, these remain unique tailwinds for us, ones we always recognize and value. I also want to take this opportunity to thank everyone across the organization for bringing continued focus and intensity to our mission, particularly during an active Q2 that represented a transitional quarter for us. Before covering the quarter's specific initiatives and results, I want to provide a high-level update on where we've been and where we're looking to go as our transformation progresses. When our Board began turning over early last year, GameStop was saddled with significant debt, decaying systems, limited employee depth and a host of other issues. This is why we spent the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022 making up for years of underinvestment in modernizing the business. The upshot is we\",\n",
       "  'U.S. stocks rose for a second straight session Thursday after swinging between gains and losses for much of the trading day. The S&P 500 climbed 0.7%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average and technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite each advanced 0.6%. All eyes were on Federal Reserve Chair Powell Thursday as he spoke at the Cato Institute’s 40th Annual Monetary Conference in Washington D.C. The U.S. central bank chief reasserted the Fed\\'s commitment to fighting inflation but remained hopeful the endeavor can be done without the \"very high social costs\" of monetary tightening. The appearance marked Powell’s final public remarks before the Fed’s next policy announcement September 21.

Economists called for 240,00 claims, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank delivered an unprecedented 75 basis point interest rate hike and signaled further increases after inflation in the eurozone hit a new record high. The increase came just two weeks before the Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates in the U.S. by 0.75% for the third consecutive time.

       " 'TSLA': [\"I drove a Tesla for the first time and came away impressed with the much-hyped brand. The Model Y's sleek interior, speedy acceleration, and innovative tech features set it apart. But its oversized touchscreen and lack of physical buttons isn't for everyone. Tesla created and dominates the burgeoning market for electric vehicles. But can the company's popular cars withstand a barrage of competitors from titans like Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen? That's the big question I sought to answer when I got behind the wheel of a new Tesla Model Y SUV earlier this month. After testing more than a dozen battery-powered rides in the last year — but never one made by Elon Musk — I wondered whether Teslas can live up to the hype or not. Put differently: Are the company's fanatical supporters right, or are its cars nothing special? I borrowed a friend's Tesla to find out for myself. (The company doesn't offer press loans, so journalists have to get creative.) The Model Y is Tesla's small SUV and its most popular product. It has a starting price of $65,990 and two motors that provide all-wheel drive. A Performance version that sacrifices some range for added quickness is available for $4,000 extra, but the base model is plenty sporty. Tesla doesn't have dealerships and instead sells its cars online, direct-to-consumer. Buyers can take delivery at a Tesla location or have their vehicle shipped to their home. Slide into a Tesla and you'll find a refreshingly uncluttered interior free of conventional buttons, vents, and gauges. The cabin's sleek design and understated wood trim more evoke an Apple store than an automobile. This minimalist look is made possible by a large touchscreen that controls practically all important vehicle functions aside from stopping, going, and turning. This command center contains the door locks, A/C settings, speedometer, and navigation system. It's also stuffed with outside-the-box features like games, a digital whoopee cushion, and Netflix, which can help owners pass the time while charging. The display is super responsive to taps and swipes and features crisp graphics. Plus, Tesla regularly adds new\",\n",

       "  'At the Goldman Sachs tech conference in San Francisco yesterday, Tesla’s (TSLA.) head of investor relations, Martin Viecha, laid out a cheery future for the automaker. His remarks were shared by Business Insider via an attendee at the event. Viecha covered two big topic areas: the costs associated with making EVs, and the outlook for battery technology and the supply of materials. Highlights: In the car business, gross margin is a big deal, basically measuring how much profit an automaker can extract from each car produced. Thus, Viecha said the per vehicle cost is the top metric to track in the coming years. Controlling costs would be the most important factor in how many cars an automaker could make—and how big a company, Tesla in this case, could become. Example: Viecha said in 2017 it cost Tesla $84,000 to make a car. Now that cost has come down to $36,000 in recent quarters. Viecha said almost none of those cost efficiencies came from cheaper batteries; he attributed the savings from better vehicle design that made building the cars easier. Viecha also said Tesla could further reduce the cost of its vehicles by building more in newer, more efficient, factories in Berlin, Austin and Shanghai. Viecha believes another revolution in automotive manufacturing is possible - following Ford’s Model T assembly line and Toyota’s cheaper “lean production” techniques. \"EV architecture is so different from internal combustion engine, it allows for a third revolution in automotive manufacturing,\" Viecha said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had promised to build a cheaper Tesla for the masses, one that costs around $25,000. The Model 3 was supposed to be in the $35,000 MSRP range; the cheapest Model 3, however, now costs around $47,000 per Tesla\\'s website. Viecha also, at the conference, addressed the possibility of producing a cheaper EV, claiming the company wants an entry-level car to broaden out its portfolio. Why? The cheaper EV is necessary for Tesla to be a high-volume automaker, Viecha said. (And would also be important to have in place before Tesla embarks on its robotaxi service.) As for new models, Viecha',\n",
       "  'When Covid-19 entered our lives, people started re-thinking how they vacation and some are choosing alternative modes of transportation. My family has switched entirely to road-tripping post-Covid-19. To date we’ve driven to Florida, Georgia, and Minnesota twice with plans to drive to Cape Cod and Georgia later this year — all in an electric car. Why did we switch? I’ve always dreaded flying with kids. Two young kids, two car seats, a stroller, plus all the luggage. And it’s expensive — four plane tickets plus a rental car can easily cost over $2,000. If you’ve ever driven a long distance with young kids you know that you need to stop often for bathroom breaks and the stops take some time — with my family these stops can last 15 minutes if we move as quickly as possible or over 30 minutes if we need to eat a meal. It so happens that this is about how long a Tesla takes to charge at a Supercharger — stops average to about 25 minutes each every two to three hours. In our 8,000 miles of road-trips in a Tesla we have had to wait for the car to finish charging a handful of times and when we do have extra time we run around and stretch our legs or boot up Disney+ on the cars screen and watch something for 10 minutes. If you are traveling alone or with another adult trying to get to your destination as fast as possible the car will slow you down — but this will change soon as chargers get faster. The new Lucid Air is capable of adding 100 miles of range in only 5.5 minutes and 200 miles in 12 minutes on a 250kW charger. Electric vehicle adoption in the US is still in its early days.

Tesla threatened to take legal action against a tech CEO who launched a viral ad campaign criticizing the carmaker\\'s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. The carmaker has accused Dan O\\'Dowd and his advocacy group, The Dawn Project, of a defaming Tesla and misrepresenting its software in an ad campaign that appeared to show the software failing to recognize a child-sized mannequin and crashing into it at about 25 miles per hour. A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication. In a cease and desist letter dated August 11, Tesla demands that O\\'Dowd, the CEO of Green Hills Software, take the video down, issue a public retraction, and send all material from the video to Tesla within 24 hours of receiving the letter. \"The purported tests misuse and misrepresent the capabilities of Tesla\\'s technology, and disregard widely recognized testing performed by independent agencies as well as the experiences shared by our customers,\" the letter reads. \"In fact, unsolicited scrutiny of the methodology behind The Dawn Project\\'s tests has already (and within hours of you publicly making defamatory allegations) shown that the testing is seriously deceptive and likely fraudulent.\" When the video was released several Tesla fans and blogs questioned whether the car was really under the influence of FSD or if the test was tampered with, sparking copycat tests, including some attempts to test the software with real children. The Dawn Project has said the test was performed by a professional test driver under affidavit. But, it was not conducted with the oversight of a US regulator — meaning it was not subject to any testing standards.

City Navigation Guided Pilot (City NGP), an expanded version of XPeng's NGP, which performed tasks like assisted driving on highways based on the navigation route set by the driver, is being tested on a pilot basis in Guangzhou. Certain XPeng P5 family sedan customers in the city can now get access to City NGP via an over-the-air update before a wider rollout, according to the company. XPeng's City NGP has been compared to Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software -- XPeng's tech promises to do similar things to Tesla's ADAS, including cruise control, automatic lane changes, navigating around stationary vehicles or obstacles, detecting and reacting to traffic lights, taking left or right turns, navigating through intersections and avoiding obstructions like construction, pedestrians and cyclists. At least, that's what the technology promises to do; whether it will perform as advertised is another question. Tesla has faced myriad complaints and lawsuits for failing to meet its promised capabilities. Tesla and XPeng aim to eventually achieve full autonomous driving through sequential rollouts of their driver assist systems purchased and tested by drivers on real roads. The main difference, and one that may be the key here, is in the companies' sensor stacks. Tesla has doggedly pursued a vision-only approach to full self-driving that is based on cameras and neural network processing. XPeng, like most other companies aiming for autonomous driving, has a full suite of sensors that include cameras, lidar and radar. “With the rollout of City NGP, XPeng is spearheading a strategic road map to complete our ADAS coverage from highways and parking lots to much more complex city driving scenarios, offering our customers enhanced safety and an optimized driving experience,” He Xiaopeng, chairman and CEO of XPeng, said in a statement. “We believe the continuous evolvement of City NGP and the expansion of its coverage will accelerate\",\n",

No doubt this spooked investors across the board who are already fearing another rate hike by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation. Nevertheless, a prudent investor may utilize this situation to buy stocks that are safe bets amid the ongoing economic turmoil. Some such stocks are Tesla TSLA, EchoStar SATS, Amalgamated Financial AMAL, Titan Machinery TITN and PBF Energy PBF. These stocks bear low leverage.Now one might think why low leverage stocks?For this, one should be well acquainted with what leverage is and how choosing low-leverage stocks can keep an investor away from incurring huge losses. Basically, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are primarily done through debt financing, although there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing. However, at times debt financing can be detrimental for a company’s prospects, especially when a company bears too much debt compared to its assets. So, one should look for stocks that are not heavily burdened with debt.So, the next step should be how to identify such stocks that are not overburdened with debt as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.  To identify such stocks, historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios. Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ Equity This metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company.

Managing Director of Swan Advisor Services Andrew Edstrom told CoinDesk that its latest product expands its reach to institutional clients and investors looking to step into crypto. “Most advisors are still getting up to speed on [bitcoin] in terms of their research and their knowledge of it. This is really an untapped market,” Edstrom told CoinDesk. Swan Advisor Services users can transact and manage their clients’ bitcoin positions on the platform, as well as access educational content to help onboard clients new to crypto.

Swan has been bolstering its suite of bitcoin products to make investment opportunities accessible to both crypto natives and crypto-curious investors. In March, it teamed up with Prime Trust to support its crypto retirement product, while in May, it kicked off the Bitcoin Benefit Plan to provide bitcoin bonuses to employees of participating companies. The traditional finance world has been moving into crypto primarily through bitcoin investments; however, Ethereum’s upcoming Merge may push tradfi into crypto through ether-based products. Swan only offers bitcoin products, and Edstrom told CoinDesk that he views the Merge as an event that will make it easier for investors to differentiate between bitcoin and ether. “There's likely to be a very large component of the advisor space that realizes that bitcoin makes a lot more sense for their clients than Ethereum or than a basket of assets,” Edstrom said. Swan has already onboarded five advisors to its product ahead of its release date. One of those advisors, Isaiah Douglass, partner at Vincere Wealth Management, told CoinDesk in an email that he believes institutional adoption is well on the way, and hopes to help onboard his clients to the asset. “Bitcoin is ultimately going through the monetization process and I believe it will be the choice of money worldwide in my lifetime,” said Douglass.

The largest digital token dropped as much as 7.8% and was trading at $18,741.50 as of 7:00 a.m. in New York. Investors are bracing for volatility in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hike expected on Wednesday. bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE): Shares of bluebird bio Inc. were higher by more than 9% in premarket trading Monday after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a personalized gene therapy for an ultra-rare childhood brain disease, called cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy or CALD. The therapy is built from a patient’s own stem cells and will be the first to be made available in the U.S. This is the second clearance from the FDA for bluebird bio in the last four weeks, following another gene therapy for the blood disorder beta thalassemia. Ethereum USD (ETH-USD): Ethereum price tumbled to its lowest level since late July. The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dipped below $1,300, continuing its post-Merge dip. Last week, Ethereum moved to a more energy efficient proof-of-stake method for securing the network. Since then, Ethereum has lost more than 20% of its value, with its market cap now standing at around $159 billion. Coinbase Global, Inc.

PRESS RELEASE / IR MESSAGENorthern Data releases shareholder letter Frankfurt/Main – 19 September 2022Dear Stakeholders, Partners and Friends of Northern Data Thank you for your patience as we have worked through our 2021 financial accounts, before concluding the audit process last month. The results confirm strong growth and record results in the fiscal year 2021. 2022 is a much more challenging year. As many of you know, the current market volatility has created uncertainty for the technology sector and particularly the crypto currency mining sector. While Northern Data is much more than just a crypto currency miner, revenues resulting from our Bitcoin and Ethereum mining activities still constitute the vast majority of our overall group revenues in FY2022. For cryptocurrency mining, the three main factors are the trading price of the respective cryptocurrency, the price of energy, and the price of hardware. At least the first two factors face severe headwinds at the moment. Bitcoin is testing lows, and energy prices are skyrocketing. Despite these challenges, we expect to grow our topline for 2022 and are forecasting total revenues of approximately EUR 200\\xa0-\\xa0250 million for the financial year 2022. We expect to deliver a positive, adjusted EBITDA of EUR 40\\xa0–\\xa075 million. Most importantly, we are convinced of the long-term macro factors and that we have the right strategy to succeed. We believe – as severe as the current downturn might be – that this is just an interim set back in the long-term mega cycle of the rise of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and in general a data-driven and data-hungry world, which will create a massive demand for HPC data center solutions. We are confident that Northern Data will be a key infrastructure pillar of this exciting world. We take a long-term view on our strategy, maintaining focus on the big picture rather than on',\n",
       "  'The U.S. central bank is expected to deliver a third-straight 75-basis-point increase at the conclusion of discussions on Wednesday Written by Christopher Liew, CFA at The Motley Fool Canada The hyped transition of the Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) blockchain to the proof-of-stake (PoS) network on September 15, 2022, was successful. Many investors in the crypto space have high hopes that the landmark event will create new trends and drive the digital asset market. Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), the first mover in the cryptocurrency market and the most valuable, could become the second lead to Ethereum. Carol Alexander, professor of Finance at the University of Sussex Business School, said, “The Merge is the most important event in blockchain history.” Ms. Alexander opines that the so-called Merge marks the beginning of the end of Bitcoin’s dominance over crypto assets. She added, “Ethereum is achieving something that Bitcoin never could because Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset, and its mining network would never agree to drop that source of income.” The Ethereum ecosystem has a new look after moving away from the energy-intensive mining process known as proof-of-work (PoW). Alex de Vries, an economist at Digiconomist, estimated that carbon emissions linked to Ethereum to reduce by more than 99%. According to de Vries, 0.2% of the world’s electricity consumption will disappear overnight because of the more energy-efficient PoS mechanism. The Merge, or Ethereum 2.0, can process more transactions per second, use less energy, and become more secure. Moreover, Ethereum could be the most widely adopted chain, as it prepares to move to sharding, the final phase of Ethereum 2.0. Sharding aims to improve efficiency by dividing the network into a subset of nodes. Ethereum will no longer execute all transactions on a singular blockchain but instead spread transactions and computations across several subsets or partitions in the network. The issue against Bitcoin is the environmental impact of the PoW mechanism. Because it requires a lot of computing power, the most valuable digital asset is the largest polluter in the crypto space. Before the Merge, Ethereum accounted for 20-39% of total global crypto-asset electricity usage. As of August',\n",

(Nasdaq: CLSK) (the \"Company\" or \"CleanSpark\"), America’s bitcoin miner, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the calendar year-to-date ending August 31, 2022. “We set out at the beginning of the year to become a top five publicly traded bitcoin mining company and with our outstanding operational performance in 2022 we can say we are now firmly in that category. We now own and operate three campuses in Georgia. Our hashrate has tripled over the last year.

Market observers said BTC’s trading volume was almost twice its 20-day moving average. Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) also breached the resistance level of US$1,700 to end the week. This second-largest cryptocurrency is preparing to transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) system next week. The so-called “Merge,” or the critical upgrade of ETH’s blockchain network, could radically change the processing of transactions and disrupt crypto trading. Bitcoin bulls say the outperformance relative to other digital assets could mean the sell-off is overdone. The first-mover in the crypto space rose 10% despite the lack of a catalyst. BTC also shrugged off rising interest rates. However, the sentiment could turn bullish if the U.S. Federal Reserve slows the pace of rate hikes in 2023. Daniel Kostecki, a senior market analyst at Conotoxia, said, “If buyers continue with the same sentiment, even an area of $22,400 to $23,000 could be reached.” Sheraz Ahmed, the managing partner at Storm Partners, adds, “The move could be seen as part of the larger realization of the undervalued digital asset market.” Some crypto analysts say the flagship cryptocurrency isn’t competing with Ethereum because they are fundamentally different. Bitcoin enables decentralized finance, and Ethereum primarily enables apps and contracts, although its design is much broader in scope. Bitcoin consistently delivered high returns since losing by 72.6% in 2018. The average return of the top crypto in the last three years (2019 to 2021) is 149.2%, and its highest gain was 302.8% in 2020. Before the crypto winter, BTC hit an all-time high of US$67,566.83 on November 8, 2022. While BTC is still losing by 53.88% year-to-date, the current price of US$21,355.14 represents a 13.34% increase from US$18,837.67 on September 6, 2022. However, despite hitting a two-week high, not everyone in the crypto market is convinced that the rally could sustain. Kostecki']}"

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Bed Bath & Beyond is close to finalizing a loan of nearly $400 million as it seeks to boost liquidity. Shares of the meme stock have soared this month and on pace for a record monthly gain in August, with the stock rallying more than 170%. Bed Bath & Beyond’s gains lifted other meme favorites, including GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Best Buy (BBY): Best Buy is in focus ahead of its quarterly results before the bell Tuesday. The company cut its full year profit and sales forecast in July, citing softening demand. Best Buy CEO Corie Barry wrote “as high inflation has continued and consumer sentiment has deteriorated, customer demand within the consumer electronics industry has softened even further, leading to Q2 financial results below the expectations we shared in May.” The retailer is expected to post adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.35 per share on revenue of $10.33 billion, according to Wall Street's consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Baidu (BIDU): Baidu shares fell Monday ahead of the Chinese tech giant’s earnings Tuesday before the bell. Covid disruptions are expected to weigh on results, with the Street forecasting its first negative sales growth in two years. Daily active users for the quarter are estimated to total 228.4 million. Peloton (PTON): Peloton filed to delay its 10-K, saying it requires more time to complete accounting disclosures. According to the regulatory filing, Peloton needs additional time “to permit completion of the accounting and disclosures” related to its recent announcement to exit its last mile warehouses, “including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as it relates to its accounts and disclosures related to these strategic business developments and for its registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, to complete its necessary audit procedures over these matters,” according to the filing.

Contributing to the favorable trends are the regional results of graduates who studied in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. Among graduates of Asia-Pacific business schools, this year 91 percent report being employed at the time of graduation, compared with 78 percent in 2021. Similarly, among European graduates, 90 percent indicate they were employed this year compared with 75 percent last year. The annual Enrolled Students Survey from GMAC, a global association of leading graduate business schools, aims to better understand current trends in student and recent graduates’ evaluations and outcomes of their graduate management education (GME). Conducted in May-June 2022, this year’s survey explores the views of 1,718 respondents from nearly 300 business schools in 57 countries around the word on their overall GME experience, job search, and compensation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, the responding graduates of participating schools reported a median percentage increase in total compensation—including base salary and all other compensation—of 29 percent. Notably, among North American school graduates, those who attended full-time MBA programs reported a pre-GME total compensation median of US$80,000, and a post-GME total compensation median of US$120,000—an impressive 50 percent increase. “With the volatile economic conditions and organizational challenges brought on by the pandemic, well-rounded and prepared business leaders and managers are especially in demand in the current job market,” said Matt Hazenbush, director of research analysis and communications at GMAC and author of the report. “As the survey findings suggest, graduate management education provides students with a powerful leg up for their career.” Other Key Findings Most students who set out to make a career change or gain a promotion',\n",

       "  \"Meme stocks, once the darling of the stock market last year, have seen a huge resurgence this month. This is especially thanks to easing inflation, a drop in Treasury yields and declining commodity prices that have resulted in risk-on trade. Additionally, attractive valuations drove investors to these stocks (read: Dow Jones Reclaims 34,000: ETFs to Ride On).As such, ETFs targeting meme stocks like Roundhill MEME ETF MEME, VanEck Social Sentiment ETF BUZZ, SoFi Social 50 ETF SFYF and AXS FOMO ETF FOMO have been on the rise over the past month.In fact, trading in single stock options has shot higher in recent weeks, with a 10-day average daily trading volume at a more-than six-month high of nearly 25 million contracts, per Trade Alert data.Meme stocks are those that grabbed immense investor interest due to hype on social media and online forums like Reddit, WallStreetBets and Robinhood, rather than the company fundamentals, resulting in a surge in volumes and share price. Meme stocks are triggered by small traders who cause a short squeeze on the stock. Short squeeze is a term used by market participants to refer to a phenomenon where short sellers in a stock, who have placed their bets on its fall, rush to hedge their positions or buy the stock in the event of an adverse price movement, in order to cover their losses. This leads to a sharp rise in demand for shares, and a huge rally in share prices. On Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, Bed Bath & Beyond BBBY, GameStop GME, and AMC Entertainment AMC were among the top 10 most talked about stocks. Since the June 17 bottom, Bed Bath, GameStop and AMC Entertainment surged 65.1%, 8% and 43.8%, respectively. Investors betting against the three well-known meme stocks have lost about $1.65 billion this month after the shares soared in value, prompting a short squeeze.The return of the meme craze indicates that investors are getting more comfortable with taking on more risk in their portfolios after they saw big declines in some of their favorite stock holdings. However, investing in these stocks is a risky choice\",\n",
       "  \"No-fee trading has transformed the retail trading landscape, making it possible for everyday traders to participate in the markets. Payment For Order Flow (PFOF) — fees for trades paid to brokerages by market makers like Citadel and Virtu — have garnered increased attention since the GameStop (GME) saga grabbed national attention last year. A new study aimed at identifying variation in price execution across different brokers using six accounts found a large variation among platforms such as Robinhood (HOOD) and E-trade. “There's just a huge difference in execution between the six different brokers that we used,” said Christopher Schwarz, University of California Irvine professor of finance and faculty director of the Center for Investment and Wealth Management. “Essentially, what we found is the amount the broker is getting paid for the trades really had no relation to how much execution your — what price execution you were getting. And there's really no way for you to know ahead of time which broker was giving you the best price execution of these trades and which broker was giving you the worst execution,” said Schwarz. Although the study aims to look at the dynamics surrounding no-fee trading and PFOF, when asked, Schwarz mentioned the brokerage with the best outcome. “The best broker in terms of market trades only, looking at market trades only, was TD Ameritrade. They were number one,” said Schwarz. The professor's team found price execution data needs to be provided at the broker level. This way consumers can better compare brokerages. “In other words, what Citadel gives you is just an average of the price execution they'll give you on any Apple trade. And, essentially, what we found is the market centers are systematically giving brokers different pricing,” said Schwarz. To solve this, market makers should say “exactly what kind of pricing you get at TD versus Robinhood versus eTrade versus Fidelity. And then consumers have a much better way to make a comparison about what kind of price execution that they're getting,” he added. Ines is a markets reporter covering equities.

The S&P 500 climbed 0.7%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average and technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite each advanced 0.6%. All eyes were on Federal Reserve Chair Powell Thursday as he spoke at the Cato Institute’s 40th Annual Monetary Conference in Washington D.C. The U.S. central bank chief reasserted the Fed\\'s commitment to fighting inflation but remained hopeful the endeavor can be done without the \"very high social costs\" of monetary tightening. The appearance marked Powell’s final public remarks before the Fed’s next policy announcement September 21. Thursday\\'s seesaw session comes after the S&P 500 surged 1.8% Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average about 1.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite 2.1% – snapping a seven-day streak of declines and notching its biggest jump in four weeks. On the economic data front, initial jobless claims fell to the lowest reading since May. Filings for first-time unemployment insurance totaled 222,000 in the week ended Sept. 3, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists called for 240,00 claims, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank delivered an unprecedented 75 basis point interest rate hike and signaled further increases after inflation in the eurozone hit a new record high. The increase came just two weeks before the Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates in the U.S. by 0.75% for the third consecutive time. Some market participants had hoped that policymakers would slow the pace of their rate-hiking campaign this fall, but strong economic data on the labor and manufacturing fronts have tempered those expectations. CME Group\\'s Fedwatch tool reflects expectations for a bump of three quarters of a percentage at about 86%, up from 69% one week ago. A flurry of Wall Street institutions have also raised their bets on a 75-basis-point hike this month including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Nomura.

But its oversized touchscreen and lack of physical buttons isn't for everyone. Tesla created and dominates the burgeoning market for electric vehicles. But can the company's popular cars withstand a barrage of competitors from titans like Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen? That's the big question I sought to answer when I got behind the wheel of a new Tesla Model Y SUV earlier this month. After testing more than a dozen battery-powered rides in the last year — but never one made by Elon Musk — I wondered whether Teslas can live up to the hype or not. Put differently: Are the company's fanatical supporters right, or are its cars nothing special? I borrowed a friend's Tesla to find out for myself. (The company doesn't offer press loans, so journalists have to get creative.) The Model Y is Tesla's small SUV and its most popular product. It has a starting price of $65,990 and two motors that provide all-wheel drive. A Performance version that sacrifices some range for added quickness is available for $4,000 extra, but the base model is plenty sporty. Tesla doesn't have dealerships and instead sells its cars online, direct-to-consumer. Buyers can take delivery at a Tesla location or have their vehicle shipped to their home. Slide into a Tesla and you'll find a refreshingly uncluttered interior free of conventional buttons, vents, and gauges. The cabin's sleek design and understated wood trim more evoke an Apple store than an automobile. This minimalist look is made possible by a large touchscreen that controls practically all important vehicle functions aside from stopping, going, and turning.

Viecha covered two big topic areas: the costs associated with making EVs, and the outlook for battery technology and the supply of materials. Highlights: In the car business, gross margin is a big deal, basically measuring how much profit an automaker can extract from each car produced. Thus, Viecha said the per vehicle cost is the top metric to track in the coming years. Controlling costs would be the most important factor in how many cars an automaker could make—and how big a company, Tesla in this case, could become. Example: Viecha said in 2017 it cost Tesla $84,000 to make a car. Now that cost has come down to $36,000 in recent quarters. Viecha said almost none of those cost efficiencies came from cheaper batteries; he attributed the savings from better vehicle design that made building the cars easier. Viecha also said Tesla could further reduce the cost of its vehicles by building more in newer, more efficient, factories in Berlin, Austin and Shanghai. Viecha believes another revolution in automotive manufacturing is possible - following Ford’s Model T assembly line and Toyota’s cheaper “lean production” techniques. \"EV architecture is so different from internal combustion engine, it allows for a third revolution in automotive manufacturing,\" Viecha said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had promised to build a cheaper Tesla for the masses, one that costs around $25,000. The Model 3 was supposed to be in the $35,000 MSRP range; the cheapest Model 3, however, now costs around $47,000 per Tesla\\'s website. Viecha also, at the conference, addressed the possibility of producing a cheaper EV, claiming the company wants an entry-level car to broaden out its portfolio. Why? The cheaper EV is necessary for Tesla to be a high-volume automaker, Viecha said. (And would also be important to have in place before Tesla embarks on its robotaxi service.) As for new models, Viecha',\n",
       "  'When Covid-19 entered our lives, people started re-thinking how they vacation and some are choosing alternative modes of transportation. My family has switched entirely to road-tripping post-Covid-19. To date we’ve driven to Florida, Georgia, and Minnesota twice with plans to drive to Cape Cod and Georgia later this year — all in an electric car. Why did we switch? I’ve always dreaded flying with kids. Two young kids, two car seats, a stroller, plus all the luggage. And it’s expensive — four plane tickets plus a rental car can easily cost over $2,000. If you’ve ever driven a long distance with young kids you know that you need to stop often for bathroom breaks and the stops take some time — with my family these stops can last 15 minutes if we move as quickly as possible or over 30 minutes if we need to eat a meal. It so happens that this is about how long a Tesla takes to charge at a Supercharger — stops average to about 25 minutes each every two to three hours. In our 8,000 miles of road-trips in a Tesla we have had to wait for the car to finish charging a handful of times and when we do have extra time we run around and stretch our legs or boot up Disney+ on the cars screen and watch something for 10 minutes. If you are traveling alone or with another adult trying to get to your destination as fast as possible the car will slow you down — but this will change soon as chargers get faster. The new Lucid Air is capable of adding 100 miles of range in only 5.5 minutes and 200 miles in 12 minutes on a 250kW charger. Electric vehicle adoption in the US is still in its early days. According to Yaa, in Q2 2022 BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles) had a 5.6 percent market share, up from 2.7 percent in Q2 2021. In 2021 BEV made up 10.6 percent of new vehicle purchases.

Dan O\\'Dowd has said he does not plan to back down, despite Tesla\\'s legal threat. Tesla threatened to take legal action against a tech CEO who launched a viral ad campaign criticizing the carmaker\\'s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. The carmaker has accused Dan O\\'Dowd and his advocacy group, The Dawn Project, of a defaming Tesla and misrepresenting its software in an ad campaign that appeared to show the software failing to recognize a child-sized mannequin and crashing into it at about 25 miles per hour. A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication. In a cease and desist letter dated August 11, Tesla demands that O\\'Dowd, the CEO of Green Hills Software, take the video down, issue a public retraction, and send all material from the video to Tesla within 24 hours of receiving the letter. \"The purported tests misuse and misrepresent the capabilities of Tesla\\'s technology, and disregard widely recognized testing performed by independent agencies as well as the experiences shared by our customers,\" the letter reads. \"In fact, unsolicited scrutiny of the methodology behind The Dawn Project\\'s tests has already (and within hours of you publicly making defamatory allegations) shown that the testing is seriously deceptive and likely fraudulent.\" When the video was released several Tesla fans and blogs questioned whether the car was really under the influence of FSD or if the test was tampered with, sparking copycat tests, including some attempts to test the software with real children. The Dawn Project has said the test was performed by a professional test driver under affidavit. But, it was not conducted with the oversight of a US regulator — meaning it was not subject to any testing standards. In a lengthy response to the cease and desist letter, O\\'Dowd said he is not backing down. \"I dare you to come out and defend this technology,\" O\\'Dowd said in response to Tesla\\'s letter.',\n",

       "  \"From NI to tax cuts  – what the chancellor of the exchequer could announce at his first fiscal event XPeng, a Chinese smart electric vehicle startup, has launched its anticipated advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that automates some driving functions in urban environments. City Navigation Guided Pilot (City NGP), an expanded version of XPeng's NGP, which performed tasks like assisted driving on highways based on the navigation route set by the driver, is being tested on a pilot basis in Guangzhou. Certain XPeng P5 family sedan customers in the city can now get access to City NGP via an over-the-air update before a wider rollout, according to the company. XPeng's City NGP has been compared to Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software -- XPeng's tech promises to do similar things to Tesla's ADAS, including cruise control, automatic lane changes, navigating around stationary vehicles or obstacles, detecting and reacting to traffic lights, taking left or right turns, navigating through intersections and avoiding obstructions like construction, pedestrians and cyclists. At least, that's what the technology promises to do; whether it will perform as advertised is another question. Tesla has faced myriad complaints and lawsuits for failing to meet its promised capabilities. Tesla and XPeng aim to eventually achieve full autonomous driving through sequential rollouts of their driver assist systems purchased and tested by drivers on real roads. The main difference, and one that may be the key here, is in the companies' sensor stacks. Tesla has doggedly pursued a vision-only approach to full self-driving that is based on cameras and neural network processing. XPeng, like most other companies aiming for autonomous driving, has a full suite of sensors that include cameras, lidar and radar. “With the rollout of City NGP, XPeng is spearheading a strategic road map to complete our ADAS coverage from highways and parking lots to much more complex city driving scenarios, offering our customers enhanced safety and an optimized driving experience,” He Xiaopeng, chairman and CEO of XPeng, said in a statement. “We believe the continuous evolvement of City NGP and the expansion of its coverage will accelerate\",\n",

No doubt this spooked investors across the board who are already fearing another rate hike by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation. Nevertheless, a prudent investor may utilize this situation to buy stocks that are safe bets amid the ongoing economic turmoil. Some such stocks are Tesla TSLA, EchoStar SATS, Amalgamated Financial AMAL, Titan Machinery TITN and PBF Energy PBF. These stocks bear low leverage.Now one might think why low leverage stocks?For this, one should be well acquainted with what leverage is and how choosing low-leverage stocks can keep an investor away from incurring huge losses. Basically, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are primarily done through debt financing, although there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing. However, at times debt financing can be detrimental for a company’s prospects, especially when a company bears too much debt compared to its assets. So, one should look for stocks that are not heavily burdened with debt.So, the next step should be how to identify such stocks that are not overburdened with debt as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.  To identify such stocks, historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios. Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ Equity This metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company. With the second-quarter earnings cycle behind us, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past.

Bitcoin and Ether are still both down about 50% this year. “It’s too early to predict that we are approaching another bull run, but if Bitcoin regains a higher support level between $22,000-$25,000 then it may boost investor confidence and ease off the selling pressure across crypto assets,” said Tarusha Mittal, co-founder of crypto staking platform UniFarm. “Given the fact that central banks around the world remain cautious due to the high inflation numbers, the current surge in the crypto market might be short-lived,” she adds.

BTC rose above US$24,000 two weeks ago, only to lose momentum in the ensuing days. As of this writing, the price is down to US$20,366.51, and Bitcoin holders are losing by 56% year to date. Because of the aggressive stance of the Feds to curb inflation through multiple rate hikes, expect the risk appetite for volatile assets to keep falling.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week the central bank would continue with its tightening cycle. Bitcoin tanked 5.66% following Powell’s comments that the current situation requires a restrictive policy for some time. The dilemma of crypto investors is whether to buy or sell BTC before 2023.

Called Swan Advisor Services, it provides a platform for financial advisors to allow clients to purchase bitcoin, the firm said Wednesday. Managing Director of Swan Advisor Services Andrew Edstrom told CoinDesk that its latest product expands its reach to institutional clients and investors looking to step into crypto. “Most advisors are still getting up to speed on [bitcoin] in terms of their research and their knowledge of it. This is really an untapped market,” Edstrom told CoinDesk. Swan Advisor Services users can transact and manage their clients’ bitcoin positions on the platform, as well as access educational content to help onboard clients new to crypto. All tokens are custodied by crypto firm Prime Trust. Swan has been bolstering its suite of bitcoin products to make investment opportunities accessible to both crypto natives and crypto-curious investors. In March, it teamed up with Prime Trust to support its crypto retirement product, while in May, it kicked off the Bitcoin Benefit Plan to provide bitcoin bonuses to employees of participating companies. The traditional finance world has been moving into crypto primarily through bitcoin investments; however, Ethereum’s upcoming Merge may push tradfi into crypto through ether-based products. Swan only offers bitcoin products, and Edstrom told CoinDesk that he views the Merge as an event that will make it easier for investors to differentiate between bitcoin and ether. “There's likely to be a very large component of the advisor space that realizes that bitcoin makes a lot more sense for their clients than Ethereum or than a basket of assets,” Edstrom said. Swan has already onboarded five advisors to its product ahead of its release date. One of those advisors, Isaiah Douglass, partner at Vincere Wealth Management, told CoinDesk in an email that he believes institutional adoption is well on the way, and hopes to help onboard his clients to the asset. “Bitcoin is ultimately going through the monetization process and I believe it will be the choice of money worldwide in my lifetime,” said Douglass.

The results confirm strong growth and record results in the fiscal year 2021. 2022 is a much more challenging year.

       "  'The U.S. central bank is expected to deliver a third-straight 75-basis-point increase at the conclusion of discussions on Wednesday Written by Christopher Liew, CFA at The Motley Fool Canada The hyped transition of the Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) blockchain to the proof-of-stake (PoS) network on September 15, 2022, was successful. Many investors in the crypto space have high hopes that the landmark event will create new trends and drive the digital asset market. Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), the first mover in the cryptocurrency market and the most valuable, could become the second lead to Ethereum. Carol Alexander, professor of Finance at the University of Sussex Business School, said, “The Merge is the most important event in blockchain history.” Ms. Alexander opines that the so-called Merge marks the beginning of the end of Bitcoin’s dominance over crypto assets. She added, “Ethereum is achieving something that Bitcoin never could because Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset, and its mining network would never agree to drop that source of income.” The Ethereum ecosystem has a new look after moving away from the energy-intensive mining process known as proof-of-work (PoW). Alex de Vries, an economist at Digiconomist, estimated that carbon emissions linked to Ethereum to reduce by more than 99%. According to de Vries, 0.2% of the world’s electricity consumption will disappear overnight because of the more energy-efficient PoS mechanism. The Merge, or Ethereum 2.0, can process more transactions per second, use less energy, and become more secure. Moreover, Ethereum could be the most widely adopted chain, as it prepares to move to sharding, the final phase of Ethereum 2.0. Sharding aims to improve efficiency by dividing the network into a subset of nodes. Ethereum will no longer execute all transactions on a singular blockchain but instead spread transactions and computations across several subsets or partitions in the network. The issue against Bitcoin is the environmental impact of the PoW mechanism. Because it requires a lot of computing power, the most valuable digital asset is the largest polluter in the crypto space. Before the Merge, Ethereum accounted for 20-39% of total global crypto-asset electricity usage. As of August',\n",
       "  'Company’s hashrate exceeds 3.4 EH/s, up 19 percent from July 2022; mines 395 bitcoin for the month LAS VEGAS, Sept. 02, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CleanSpark, Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK) (the \"Company\" or \"CleanSpark\"), America’s bitcoin miner, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the calendar year-to-date ending August 31, 2022. “We set out at the beginning of the year to become a top five publicly traded bitcoin mining company and with our outstanding operational performance in 2022 we can say we are now firmly in that category. We now own and operate three campuses in Georgia. Our hashrate has tripled over the last year. We are on a trajectory to nearly double that in less than half the time it took us to get from 1 EH/s to 3 EH/s. And we are about to hire our 100th employee. I’m extremely proud of our team and their tremendous work,” said Zach Bradford, Chief Executive Officer. Bitcoin Mining & Operations Update (unaudited) Bitcoin mined in August: 395, up 109% from August 2021 Calendar year-to-date bitcoin mined: 2,642 Total BTC holdings as of August 31: 526 Total BTC converted for operations and growth in August: 388, 9% less than July 2022 Currently deployed fleet of over 36,800 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 3.4 EH/s, up 19% from July 2022 and 331% from August 2021 The Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 388 bitcoins in August 2022 at an average of approximately $23,088 per BTC (an 11% increase over last month’s average price per BTC sold). Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $8.9 million. August daily BTC mined reached a high of 13.39. Washington, GA, Site Update Technical crews in Washington have worked around the clock to bring miners online.

       "  'Economists expect headline CPI in U.S. rose 8.1% last month, a dip from an 8.5% rise for July Written by Christopher Liew, CFA at The Motley Fool Canada The cryptocurrency market capitalization rose above US$1 trillion again following a rally on September 9, 2022.\\xa0Bitcoin\\xa0(CRYPTO:BTC) climbed past US$21,000 to lead all advancers. Market observers said BTC’s trading volume was almost twice its 20-day moving average. Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) also breached the resistance level of US$1,700 to end the week. This second-largest cryptocurrency is preparing to transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) system next week. The so-called “Merge,” or the critical upgrade of ETH’s blockchain network, could radically change the processing of transactions and disrupt crypto trading. Bitcoin bulls say the outperformance relative to other digital assets could mean the sell-off is overdone. The first-mover in the crypto space rose 10% despite the lack of a catalyst. BTC also shrugged off rising interest rates. However, the sentiment could turn bullish if the U.S. Federal Reserve slows the pace of rate hikes in 2023. Daniel Kostecki, a senior market analyst at Conotoxia, said, “If buyers continue with the same sentiment, even an area of $22,400 to $23,000 could be reached.” Sheraz Ahmed, the managing partner at Storm Partners, adds, “The move could be seen as part of the larger realization of the undervalued digital asset market.” Some crypto analysts say the flagship cryptocurrency isn’t competing with Ethereum because they are fundamentally different. Bitcoin enables decentralized finance, and Ethereum primarily enables apps and contracts, although its design is much broader in scope. Bitcoin consistently delivered high returns since losing by 72.6% in 2018. The average return of the top crypto in the last three years (2019 to 2021) is 149.2%, and its highest gain was 302.8% in 2020. Before the crypto winter, BTC hit an all-time high of US$67,566.83 on November 8, 2022. While BTC is still losing by 53.88% year-to-date, the current price of US$21,355.14 represents a 13.34% increase from US$18,837.67 on September 6, 2022. However, despite hitting a two-week high, not everyone in the crypto market is convinced that the rally could sustain. Kostecki']}"
